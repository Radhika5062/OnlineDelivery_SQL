# OnlineDelivery_SQL
This is a project where I have taken a dummy data and analysed it using SQL and have answered following questions - 
--1. How many rolls were ordered?
--2. How many unique customer orders were made
--3. How many successful orders were delivered by each drivers
--4. How many rolls were delivered for each type
--5. How many Veg and Non Veg rolls were ordered by each customer
   This data will provide us information about the roll preference for each of the customers. 
   This will help in deciding marketting strategies, analysing pricing, understanding 
   which roll is popular and what kind of food preference do people have etc.
--6. What was the maximum number of rolls delivered in a single order?
--7. For each customer, how many delivered ROLLS had at least 1 change and how many had no changes?
--8. For each customer, which delivered ORDERS had at least 1 change and which ones had no changes?
   This helps to understand what changes have been requested by customers to understand if 
   there are any changes required in the recipe to better suit customers. 
--9. How many rolls were delivered that had both exclusions and extras
--10. What were the total number of rolls ordered for each hour of the day?
   This data helps business guage peak time when sales happen as well as the time of day when there are less sales. 
   This helps to understand what factors are driving sales and what needs to be done during the less busy period to drive sales - for examples 
   running some promotional offers during less busy hours.  
--12. What was the average time in minutes it took for each driver to arrive at the Fasoos HQ to pickup the order?
--13. Is there any relationship between the number of rolls and how long the order takes to prepare
  We can use the output of this data to plot chart using excel, Tableau or Power BI to understand the relationship better.\
--14. What was the average distance travelled for each customer. 
--15. What is the difference between the longest and the shortest delivery times for all orders?
  Duration field defines the time it took to delivery the order.
--16. What was the average speed for each driver for each delivery and do you notice any trend for these values?
--17. What is the successful delivery percentage for each driver?
